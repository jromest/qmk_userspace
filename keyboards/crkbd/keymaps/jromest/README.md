# jromest's Keymap for the Corne Keyboard

This is my personal keymap for the [Corne Keyboard (crkbd)](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd). It is subject to change. The goal is to use Colemak-DH with Neovim for daily programming use.

## Layers

-   Colemak-DH - Base layer, with bottom row mods.
-   Lower - Has navigation, inverted-T arrow and numpad.
-   Raise - Has symbols.
-   Adjust - Media and system control.
-   Navigation - Has vim-positioned H/J/K/L arrows keys.
-   Number - Numpad and math symbols.

## Notes

-   CapsLock and Esc have been swapped at the OS level.
-   No Function keys yet.
