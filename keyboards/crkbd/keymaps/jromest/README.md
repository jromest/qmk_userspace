# jromest's Keymap for the Corne Keyboard

This is my personal keymap for the [Corne Keyboard (crkbd)](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd). It is subject to change. The goal is to use Colemak-DH with Neovim for daily programming use.

## Layers

-   Qwerty - Persistent default layer.
-   Colemak-DH - Persistent default layer.
-   Lower - Has navigation, inverted-T arrow and numpad.
-   Raise - Has symbols.
-   Adjust - Media and system control. Switch alpha keys default layout.

## Notes

-   CapsLock and Esc keys has been swap remap in OS level.
-   Left mouse button in the right thumb cluster because mouse left button is not working.
-   No Function keys yet.
